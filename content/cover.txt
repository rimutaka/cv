* specializing on back-end, API, AWS, Web and data processing problems
* Rust, C#, TypeScript, SQL, No-SQL
* solution architecture, technical writing, team leadership

My full resume is attached below.

#### How I can help

My experience ranges from building MVPs for startups to refactoring and migration of legacy code for large companies.
