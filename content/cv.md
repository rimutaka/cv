**Challenges**: finding a balance between cost, features and h/w capabilities.

**Achievements**: launch of an R&D-heavy product on time and 30% under budget.

**Takeaways**: the value of a great team, advisors and investors.

The goal of the project was to make a smart battery-powered camera with cellular connectivity using commodity hardware and electronics.
After a series of prototypes and initial market validation, the team grew to include an electronics engineer, a 3D designer and a machine learning expert as a co-founder. Together we launched a unique and fully functional product to make cities safer for cyclists, pedestrians and road workers.

**Takeaways**: solve problems worth solving, focus, move fast.

Our mission was to help retailers list more products online by making the listing process as seamless as possible. I was solely focused on product management across Magento, Android, AWS and hardware peripherals. Most of my time was spent in shops and warehouses working
closely with customers and relaying my experiences and ideas back to the team.

demand quickly outgrew what a solo developer could provide. I shifted my role to product management, customer support and coordinating a small distributed team that stayed together for many years.
